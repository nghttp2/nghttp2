.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBh2load\fP [OPTIONS]... [URI]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
benchmarking tool for HTTP/2 and SPDY server
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <URI>
Specify URI to access.   Multiple URIs can be specified.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.  Definition of a base URI overrides all
scheme, host or port values.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-requests=<N>
Number of requests.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clients=<N>
Number of concurrent clients.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input\-file=<PATH>
Path of a file with multiple URIs are separated by EOLs.
This option will disable URIs getting from command\-line.
If \(aq\-\(aq is given as <PATH>, URIs will be read from stdin.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.  Definition of a base URI overrides all
scheme, host or port values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-max\-concurrent\-streams=(auto|<N>)
Max concurrent streams to  issue per session.  If "auto"
is given, the number of given URIs is used.
.sp
Default: \fBauto\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-window\-bits=<N>
Sets the stream level initial window size to (2**<N>)\-1.
For SPDY, 2**<N> is used instead.
.sp
Default: \fB30\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-connection\-window\-bits=<N>
Sets  the  connection  level   initial  window  size  to
(2**<N>)\-1.  For SPDY, if <N>  is strictly less than 16,
this option  is ignored.   Otherwise 2**<N> is  used for
SPDY.
.sp
Default: \fB30\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-header=<HEADER>
Add/Override a header to the requests.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ciphers=<SUITE>
Set allowed  cipher list.  The  format of the  string is
described in OpenSSL ciphers(1).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-no\-tls\-proto=<PROTOID>
Specify ALPN identifier of the  protocol to be used when
accessing http URI without SSL/TLS.
Available protocols: spdy/2, spdy/3, spdy/3.1 and h2c
.sp
Default: \fBh2c\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-data=<PATH>
Post FILE to  server.  The request method  is changed to
POST.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rate=<N>
Specifies  the  fixed  rate  at  which  connections  are
created.   The   rate  must   be  a   positive  integer,
representing the  number of  connections to be  made per
second.  When the rate is 0,  the program will run as it
normally does, creating connections at whatever variable
rate it wants.  The default value for this option is 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-num\-conns=<N>
Specifies  the total  number of  connections to  create.
The  total  number of  connections  must  be a  positive
integer.  On each connection, \fI\%\-m\fP requests are made.  The
test  stops once  as soon  as the  <N> connections  have
either  completed   or  failed.   When  the   number  of
connections is  0, the program  will run as  it normally
does, creating as many connections  as it needs in order
to make  the \fI\%\-n\fP  requests specified.  The  default value
for this option is 0.  The  \fI\%\-n\fP option is not required if
the \fI\%\-C\fP option is being used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-connection\-active\-timeout=<N>
Specifies  the maximum  time that  h2load is  willing to
keep a  connection open,  regardless of the  activity on
said  connection.   <N>  must  be  a  positive  integer,
specifying  the  number of  seconds  to  wait.  When  no
timeout value is set (either active or inactive), h2load
will keep a connection  open indefinitely, waiting for a
response.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-connection\-inactivity\-timeout=<N>
Specifies the amount  of time that h2load  is willing to
wait to see activity on a given connection.  <N> must be
a positive integer, specifying  the number of seconds to
wait.  When  no timeout value  is set (either  active or
inactive),   h2load   will   keep  a   connection   open
indefinitely, waiting for a response.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-timing\-script\-file=<PATH>
Path of a file containing one  or more lines separated by
EOLs. Each script line  is composed of  two tab\-separated
fields. The first field  represents  the time offset from
the start of execution,  expressed as a positive value of
milliseconds  with  microsecond  resolution.  The  second
field represents the URI.  This option will disable  URIs
getting  from  command\-line.  If \(aq\-\(aq  is given as <PATH>,
script  lines  will be read from stdin.  Script lines are
used in order for each client. If \fI\%\-n\fP is given, it must be
less than or equal to the number of script lines,  larger
values are clamped to the number of script lines.  If  \fI\%\-n\fP
is not given,  the number of requests will default to the
number of script lines. The scheme, host and port defined
in the  first URI  are used  solely.  Values contained in
other URIs, if  present, are  ignored.  Definition  of  a
base  URI  overrides  all  scheme, host  or port  values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-base\-uri=<URI>
Specify URI from which the scheme, host and port will be
used  for  all requests.   The  base  URI overrides  all
values  defined either  at  the command  line or  inside
input files.

.TP
.B started
The number of requests h2load has started.

The number of requests completed.
.TP
.B succeeded
The number of requests completed successfully.  Only HTTP status
code 2xx or3xx are considered as success.
.TP
.B failed
The number of requests failed, including HTTP level failures
(non\-successful HTTP status code).
.TP
.B errored
The number of requests failed, except for HTTP level failures.
This is the subset of the number reported in \fBfailed\fP and most
likely the network level failures or stream was reset by
RST_STREAM.

.TP
.B status codes
The number of status code h2load received.
.TP

requests were made via TLS, this value is the number of decrpyted
bytes.
.TP

The number of response header bytes from the server without
decompression.  For HTTP/2, this is the sum of the payload of
HEADERS frame.  For SPDY, this is the sum of the payload of
SYN_REPLY frame.

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B time for request

.TP
.B min
The minimum time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP
.B max
The maximum time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP
.B mean
The mean time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP

server.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH FLOW CONTROL
.sp
h2load sets large flow control window by default, and effectively
disables flow control to avoid under utilization of server
performance.  To set smaller flow control window, use \fI\%\-w\fP and
\fI\%\-W\fP options.  For example, use \fB\-w16 \-W16\fP to set default
window size described in HTTP/2 and SPDY protocol specification.

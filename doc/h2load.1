.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBh2load\fP [OPTIONS]... [URI]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
benchmarking tool for HTTP/2 and SPDY server
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <URI>
Specify URI to access.   Multiple URIs can be specified.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-requests=<N>
Number of requests.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clients=<N>
Number of concurrent clients.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threads=<N>
Number of native threads.
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input\-file=<FILE>
Path of a file with multiple URIs are separated by EOLs.
This option will disable URIs getting from command\-line.
If \(aq\-\(aq is given as <FILE>, URIs will be read from stdin.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-max\-concurrent\-streams=(auto|<N>)
Max concurrent streams to  issue per session.  If "auto"
is given, the number of given URIs is used.
.sp
Default: \fBauto\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-window\-bits=<N>
Sets the stream level initial window size to (2**<N>)\-1.
For SPDY, 2**<N> is used instead.
.sp
Default: \fB30\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-connection\-window\-bits=<N>
Sets  the  connection  level   initial  window  size  to
(2**<N>)\-1.  For SPDY, if <N>  is strictly less than 16,
this option  is ignored.   Otherwise 2**<N> is  used for
SPDY.
.sp
Default: \fB30\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-header=<HEADER>
Add/Override a header to the requests.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-no\-tls\-proto=<PROTOID>
Specify ALPN identifier of the  protocol to be used when
accessing http URI without SSL/TLS.
Available protocols: spdy/2, spdy/3, spdy/3.1 and h2c\-14
.sp
Default: \fBh2c\-14\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-data=<FILE>
Post FILE to  server.  The request method  is changed to
POST.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Output debug information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display this help and exit.
.UNINDENT
.SH OUTPUT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B requests
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B total
The number of requests h2load was instructed to make.
.TP
.B started
The number of requests h2load has started.
.TP
.B done
The number of requests completed.
.TP
.B succeeded
The number of requests completed successfully.  Only HTTP status
code 2xx or3xx are considered as success.
.TP
.B failed
The number of requests failed, including HTTP level failures
(non\-successful HTTP status code).
.TP
.B errored
The number of requests failed, except for HTTP level failures.
status code.  This is the subset of the number reported in
\fBfailed\fP and most likely the network level failures or stream
was reset by RST_STREAM.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B status codes
The number of status code h2load received.
.TP
.B traffic
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B total
The number of bytes received from the server "on the wire".  If
requests were made via TLS, this value is the number of decrpyted
bytes.
.TP
.B headers
The number of response header bytes from the server without
decompression.  For HTTP/2, this is the sum of the payload of
HEADERS frame.  For SPDY, this is the sum of the payload of
SYN_REPLY frame.
.TP
.B data
The number of response body bytes received from the server.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B time for request
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B min
The minimum time taken for request and response.
.TP
.B max
The maximum time taken for request and response.
.TP
.B mean
The mean time taken for request and response.
.TP
.B sd
The standard deviation of the time taken for request and response.
.TP
.B +/\- sd
The fraction of the number of requests within standard deviation
range (mean +/\- sd) against total number of successful requests.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B time for connect
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B min
The minimum time taken to connect to a server.
.TP
.B max
The maximum time taken to connect to a server.
.TP
.B mean
The mean time taken to connect to a server.
.TP
.B sd
The standard deviation of the time taken to connect to a server.
.TP
.B +/\- sd
The  fraction  of  the   number  of  connections  within  standard
deviation range (mean  +/\- sd) against total  number of successful
connections.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B time for 1st byte (of (decrypted in case of TLS) application data)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B min
The minimum time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP
.B max
The maximum time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP
.B mean
The mean time taken to get 1st byte from a server.
.TP
.B sd
The standard deviation of the time taken to get 1st byte from a
server.
.TP
.B +/\- sd
The fraction of the number of connections within standard
deviation range (mean +/\- sd) against total number of successful
connections.

.SH FLOW CONTROL
.sp
h2load sets large flow control window by default, and effectively
disables flow control to avoid under utilization of server
performance.  To set smaller flow control window, use \fI\%\-w\fP and
\fI\%\-W\fP options.  For example, use \fB\-w16 \-W16\fP to set default
window size described in HTTP/2 and SPDY protocol specification.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnghttpx\fP [OPTIONS]... [<PRIVATE_KEY> <CERT>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A reverse proxy for HTTP/2, HTTP/1 and SPDY.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <PRIVATE_KEY>
Set path  to server\(aqs private key.   Required unless \fI\%\-p\fP,
\fI\%\-\-client\fP or \fI\%\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fP are given.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <CERT>
Set path  to server\(aqs certificate.  Required  unless \fI\%\-p\fP,
\fI\%\-\-client\fP or  \fI\%\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fP are given.  To  make OCSP
stapling work, this must be absolute path.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The options are categorized into several groups.
.SS Connections
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-backend=(<HOST>,<PORT>|unix:<PATH>)[;<PATTERN>[:...]]
Set  backend  host  and   port.   The  multiple  backend
addresses are  accepted by repeating this  option.  UNIX
domain socket  can be  specified by prefixing  path name
with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/backend.sock).
.sp
Optionally, if <PATTERN>s are given, the backend address
is only used  if request matches the pattern.   If \fI\%\-s\fP or
\fI\%\-p\fP  is  used,  <PATTERN>s   are  ignored.   The  pattern
matching  is closely  designed to  ServeMux in  net/http
package of Go  programming language.  <PATTERN> consists
of path, host + path or  just host.  The path must start
with "\fI/\fP".  If  it ends with "\fI/\fP", it  matches all request
path in  its subtree.  To  deal with the request  to the
directory without  trailing slash,  the path  which ends
with "\fI/\fP" also matches the  request path which only lacks
trailing \(aq\fI/\fP\(aq  (e.g., path  "\fI/foo/\fP" matches  request path
"\fI/foo\fP").  If it does not end with "\fI/\fP", it performs exact
match against  the request path.   If host is  given, it
performs exact match against  the request host.  If host
alone  is given,  "\fI/\fP"  is  appended to  it,  so that  it
matches  all   request  paths  under  the   host  (e.g.,
specifying "nghttp2.org" equals to "nghttp2.org/").
.sp
Patterns with  host take  precedence over  patterns with
just path.   Then, longer patterns take  precedence over
shorter  ones,  breaking  a  tie by  the  order  of  the
appearance in the configuration.
.sp
If <PATTERN> is  omitted, "\fI/\fP" is used  as pattern, which
matches  all  request  paths (catch\-all  pattern).   The
catch\-all backend must be given.
.sp
When doing  a match, nghttpx made  some normalization to
pattern, request host and path.  For host part, they are
converted to lower case.  For path part, percent\-encoded
unreserved characters  defined in RFC 3986  are decoded,
and any  dot\-segments (".."  and ".")   are resolved and
removed.
.sp
For   example,   \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org/httpbin/\(aq
matches the  request host "nghttp2.org" and  the request
path "\fI/httpbin/get\fP", but does not match the request host
"nghttp2.org" and the request path "\fI/index.html\fP".
.sp
The  multiple <PATTERN>s  can  be specified,  delimiting
them            by           ":".             Specifying
\fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org:www.nghttp2.org\(aq  has  the
same  effect  to specify  \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org\(aq
and \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;www.nghttp2.org\(aq.
.sp
The backend addresses sharing same <PATTERN> are grouped
together forming  load balancing  group.
.sp
Since ";" and ":" are  used as delimiter, <PATTERN> must
not  contain these  characters.  Since  ";" has  special
meaning in shell, the option value must be quoted.

Default: \fB127.0.0.1,80\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-frontend=(<HOST>,<PORT>|unix:<PATH>)
Set  frontend  host and  port.   If  <HOST> is  \(aq*\(aq,  it
assumes  all addresses  including  both  IPv4 and  IPv6.
UNIX domain  socket can  be specified by  prefixing path
name with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/nghttpx.sock)

.B \-\-backend\-http\-proxy\-uri=<URI>
Specify      proxy       URI      in       the      form
\fI\%http:/\fP/[<USER>:<PASS>@]<PROXY>:<PORT>.    If   a   proxy
requires  authentication,  specify  <USER>  and  <PASS>.
Note that  they must be properly  percent\-encoded.  This
proxy  is used  when the  backend connection  is HTTP/2.
First,  make  a CONNECT  request  to  the proxy  and  it
connects  to the  backend  on behalf  of nghttpx.   This
forms  tunnel.   After  that, nghttpx  performs  SSL/TLS
handshake with  the downstream through the  tunnel.  The
timeouts when connecting and  making CONNECT request can
be     specified    by     \fI\%\-\-backend\-read\-timeout\fP    and
\fI\%\-\-backend\-write\-timeout\fP options.

.B \-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-file=<PATH>
Path to file that contains  random data to construct TLS
session ticket  parameters.  If aes\-128\-cbc is  given in
\fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP, the  file must  contain exactly
48    bytes.     If     aes\-256\-cbc    is    given    in
\fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP, the  file must  contain exactly
80  bytes.   This  options  can be  used  repeatedly  to
specify  multiple ticket  parameters.  If  several files
are given,  only the  first key is  used to  encrypt TLS
session  tickets.  Other  keys are  accepted but  server
will  issue new  session  ticket with  first key.   This
allows  session  key  rotation.  Please  note  that  key
rotation  does  not  occur automatically.   User  should
rearrange  files or  change options  values and  restart
nghttpx gracefully.   If opening  or reading  given file
fails, all loaded  keys are discarded and  it is treated
as if none  of this option is given.  If  this option is
not given or an error  occurred while opening or reading
a file,  key is  generated every  1 hour  internally and
they are  valid for  12 hours.   This is  recommended if
ticket  key sharing  between  nghttpx  instances is  not
required.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-memcached=<HOST>,<PORT>
Specify  address of  memcached server  to store  session
cache.   This  enables  shared TLS  ticket  key  between
multiple nghttpx  instances.  nghttpx  does not  set TLS
ticket  key  to  memcached.   The  external  ticket  key
generator  is required.   nghttpx just  gets TLS  ticket
keys from  memcached, and  use them,  possibly replacing
current set of keys.  It is  up to extern TLS ticket key
generator to  rotate keys frequently.  See  "TLS SESSION
TICKET RESUMPTION"  section in  manual page to  know the
data format in memcached entry.

.SH SERVER PUSH
.sp
nghttpx supports HTTP/2 server push in default mode.  nghttpx looks
for Link header field (\fI\%RFC 5988\fP) in response headers from
backend server and extracts URI\-reference with parameter
\fBrel=preload\fP (see \fI\%preload\fP)
and pushes those URIs to the frontend client. Here is a sample Link
header field to initiate server push:
.INDENT 0.0

Link: </fonts/font.woff>; rel=preload
Link: </css/theme.css>; rel=preload

Currently, the following restrictions are applied for server push:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
URI\-reference must not contain authority.  If it exists, it is not
pushed.  \fB/fonts/font.woff\fP and \fBcss/theme.css\fP are eligible to
be pushed.  \fBhttps://example.org/fonts/font.woff\fP and
\fB//example.org/css/theme.css\fP are not.
.IP 2. 3
The associated stream must have method "GET" or "POST".  The
associated stream\(aqs status code must be 200.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These limitations may be loosened in the future release.
.SH UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET
.sp
nghttpx supports UNIX domain socket with a filename for both frontend
and backend connections.
.sp
Please note that current nghttpx implementation does not delete a
socket with a filename.  And on start up, if nghttpx detects that the
specified socket already exists in the file system, nghttpx first
deletes it.  However, if SIGUSR2 is used to execute new binary and
both old and new configurations use same filename, new binary does not
delete the socket and continues to use it.
.SH OCSP STAPLING
.sp
OCSP query is done using external Python script
\fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP, which has been originally developed in Perl
as part of h2o project (\fI\%https://github.com/h2o/h2o\fP), and was
translated into Python.
.sp
The script file is usually installed under
\fB$(prefix)/share/nghttp2/\fP directory.  The actual path to script can
be customized using \fI\%\-\-fetch\-ocsp\-response\-file\fP option.
.SH TLS SESSION RESUMPTION
.sp
nghttpx supports TLS session resumption through both session ID and
session ticket.
.SS SESSION ID RESUMPTION
.sp
By default, session ID is shared by all worker threads.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-session\-cache\-memcached\fP is given, nghttpx will
insert serialized session data to memcached with
\fBnghttpx:tls\-session\-cache:\fP + lowercased hex string of session ID
as a memcached entry key, with expiry time 12 hours.  Session timeout
is set to 12 hours.
.SS TLS SESSION TICKET RESUMPTION
.sp
By default, session ticket is shared by all worker threads.  The
automatic key rotation is also enabled by default.  Every an hour, new
encryption key is generated, and previous encryption key becomes
decryption only key.  We set session timeout to 12 hours, and thus we
keep at most 12 keys.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-memcached\fP is given, encryption keys are
retrieved from memcached.  nghttpx just reads keys from memcached; one
has to deploy key generator program to update keys frequently (e.g.,
every 1 hour).  The example key generator tlsticketupdate.go is
available under contrib directory in nghttp2 archive.  The memcached
entry key is \fBnghttpx:tls\-ticket\-key\fP\&.  The data format stored in
memcached is the binary format described below:

All numbers in the above figure is bytes.  All integer fields are
network byte order.
.sp
First 4 bytes integer VERSION field, which must be 1.  The 2 bytes
integer LEN field gives the length of following KEY field, which
contains key.  If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP=aes\-128\-cbc is
used, LEN must be 48.  If
\fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP=aes\-256\-cbc is used, LEN must be
80.  LEN and KEY pair can be repeated multiple times to store multiple
keys.  The key appeared first is used as encryption key.  All the
remaining keys are used as decryption only.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-file\fP is given, encryption key is read
from the given file.  In this case, nghttpx does not rotate key
automatically.  To rotate key, one has to restart nghttpx (see
SIGNALS).

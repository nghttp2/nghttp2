.SH NAME
nghttpx \- HTTP/2 experimental proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nghttpx
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]... [\fI\,<PRIVATE_KEY> <CERT>\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A reverse proxy for HTTP/2, HTTP/1 and SPDY.
.TP
<PRIVATE_KEY>
Set  path  to  server's  private  key.   Required
unless  \fB\-p\fR,  \fB\-\-client\fR  or  \fB\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fR  are
given.
.TP
<CERT>
Set  path  to   server's  certificate.   Required
unless  \fB\-p\fR,  \fB\-\-client\fR  or  \fB\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fR  are
given.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
The options are categorized into several groups.
.SS "Connections:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-backend=\fR<HOST,PORT>
Set backend  host and port.  For  HTTP/1 backend,
multiple  backend   addresses  are   accepted  by
repeating this  option.  HTTP/2 backend  does not
support multiple backend  addresses and the first
occurrence of this option is used.
Default: '127.0.0.1,80'
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-frontend=\fR<HOST,PORT>
Set frontend host and port.  If <HOST> is '*', it
assumes  all addresses  including  both IPv4  and
IPv6.
Default: '*,3000'
.TP
\fB\-\-backlog=\fR<NUM>
Set  listen  backlog  size.    If  \fB\-1\fR  is  given,
libevent will choose suitable value.
Default: \fB\-1\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-backend\-ipv4\fR
Resolve backend hostname to IPv4 address only.
.TP
\fB\-\-backend\-ipv6\fR
Resolve backend hostname to IPv6 address only.
.TP
\fB\-\-backend\-http\-proxy\-uri=\fR<URI>
Specify     proxy     URI     in     the     form
http://[<USER>:<PASS>@]<PROXY>:<PORT>.     If   a
proxy requires authentication, specify <USER> and
<PASS>.    Note  that   they  must   be  properly
percent\-encoded.   This proxy  is  used when  the
backend  connection  is  HTTP/2.  First,  make  a
CONNECT request  to the proxy and  it connects to
the  backend on  behalf of  nghttpx.  This  forms
tunnel.   After  that, nghttpx  performs  SSL/TLS
handshake with the downstream through the tunnel.
The timeouts  when connecting and  making CONNECT
request       can      be       specified      by
\fB\-\-backend\-read\-timeout\fR                        and
\fB\-\-backend\-write\-timeout\fR options.

rate is unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-read\-burst=\fR<SIZE>
Set   maximum  read   burst   size  on   frontend
connection.  Setting  0 does not work,  but it is
not  a problem  because  \fB\-\-read\-rate\fR=\fI\,0\/\fR will  give
unlimited  read rate  regardless  of this  option
value.
Default: 1073741824
.TP
\fB\-\-write\-rate=\fR<RATE>
Set  maximum  average   write  rate  on  frontend
connection.  Setting 0 to this option means write
rate is unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-write\-burst=\fR<SIZE>
Set   maximum  write   burst  size   on  frontend
connection.  Setting 0 to this option means write
burst size is unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-worker\-read\-rate=\fR<RATE>
Set  maximum   average  read  rate   on  frontend
connection per worker.  Setting  0 to this option
means read rate is unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-worker\-read\-burst=\fR<SIZE>
Set   maximum  read   burst   size  on   frontend
connection per worker.  Setting  0 to this option
means read burst size is unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-worker\-write\-rate=\fR<RATE>
Set  maximum  average   write  rate  on  frontend
connection per worker.  Setting  0 to this option
means write rate is unlimited.

Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-worker\-frontend\-connections=\fR<NUM>
Set  maximum number  of simultaneous  connections
frontend accepts.  Setting 0 means unlimited.
Default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-backend\-http1\-connections\-per\-host=\fR<NUM>
Set maximum  number of backend  concurrent HTTP/1
connections per host.   This option is meaningful
when \fB\-s\fR option is used.

.SS "Mode:"
.TP
(default mode)
Accept  HTTP/2, SPDY  and HTTP/1.1  over SSL/TLS.

HTTP/1.1.  The  incoming HTTP/1.1  connection can
be upgraded to HTTP/2  through HTTP Upgrade.  The
protocol to the backend is HTTP/1.1.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-http2\-proxy\fR
Like default mode, but enable secure proxy mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-http2\-bridge\fR
Like  default  mode,  but  communicate  with  the
backend  in   HTTP/2  over  SSL/TLS.    Thus  the
incoming all connections  are converted to HTTP/2
connection  and  relayed  to  the  backend.   See
\fB\-\-backend\-http\-proxy\-uri\fR option if you are behind
the  proxy and  want  to connect  to the  outside
HTTP/2 proxy.
.TP
\fB\-\-client\fR
Accept HTTP/2 and  HTTP/1.1 without SSL/TLS.  The
incoming HTTP/1.1  connection can be  upgraded to
HTTP/2  connection  through  HTTP  Upgrade.   The
protocol  to  the  backend  is  HTTP/2.   To  use
nghttpx  as  a  forward   proxy,  use  \fB\-p\fR  option
instead.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-client\-proxy\fR
Like \fB\-\-client\fR  option, but  it also  requires the
request path  from frontend  must be  an absolute
URI, suitable for use as a forward proxy.
.SS "Logging:"
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\-level=\fR<LEVEL>
Set the  severity level  of log  output.  <LEVEL>
must  be one  of  INFO, NOTICE,  WARN, ERROR  and
FATAL.
Default: NOTICE

Set path  to write  access log.  To  reopen file,
send USR1 signal to nghttpx.
.TP
\fB\-\-accesslog\-syslog\fR
Send  access log  to syslog.   If this  option is
used, \fB\-\-access\-file\fR option is ignored.
.TP
\fB\-\-accesslog\-format=\fR<FORMAT>
Specify  format  string   for  access  log.   The
default format is combined format.  The following
variables are available:
$remote_addr: client IP address.
$time_local: local time in Common Log format.
$time_iso8601: local time in ISO 8601 format.
$request: HTTP request line.
$status: HTTP response status code.
$body_bytes_sent: the  number of bytes  sent to
client as response body.

where '_' in <VAR> is replaced with '\-'.
$remote_port: client  port.
$server_port: server port.
$request_time:   request  processing   time  in
seconds with milliseconds resolution.
$pid: PID of the running process.
$alpn:  ALPN  identifier  of the  protocol  which
generates  the  response.   For HTTP/1,  ALPN  is
always http/1.1, regardless of minor version.
Default: $remote_addr \- \- [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"
.TP
\fB\-\-errorlog\-file=\fR<PATH>
Set  path to  write error  log.  To  reopen file,
send USR1 signal to nghttpx.
Default: \fI\,/dev/stderr\/\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-errorlog\-syslog\fR
Send  error log  to  syslog.  If  this option  is
used, \fB\-\-errorlog\-file\fR option is ignored.
.TP
\fB\-\-syslog\-facility=\fR<FACILITY>
Set syslog facility to <FACILITY>.
Default: daemon
.SS "Misc:"
.TP

header field  will not  be altered  regardless of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-altsvc=\fR<PROTOID,PORT[,HOST,[ORIGIN]]>

alternative services.  Example: \fB\-\-altsvc\fR=\fI\,h2\/\fR,443
.TP
\fB\-\-add\-response\-header=\fR<HEADER>
Specify  additional   header  field  to   add  to
response  header set.   This option  just appends

specify multiple header fields.
Example: \fB\-\-add\-response\-header=\fR"foo: bar"
.TP
\fB\-\-frontend\-http2\-dump\-request\-header=\fR<PATH>
Dumps request headers received by HTTP/2 frontend
to  the file  denoted in  <PATH>.  The  output is

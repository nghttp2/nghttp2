.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnghttpx\fP [OPTIONS]... [<PRIVATE_KEY> <CERT>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A reverse proxy for HTTP/2, HTTP/1 and SPDY.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <PRIVATE_KEY>
Set path  to server\(aqs private key.   Required unless \fI\%\-p\fP,
\fI\%\-\-client\fP or \fI\%\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fP are given.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <CERT>
Set path  to server\(aqs certificate.  Required  unless \fI\%\-p\fP,
\fI\%\-\-client\fP or  \fI\%\-\-frontend\-no\-tls\fP are given.  To  make OCSP
stapling work, this must be absolute path.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The options are categorized into several groups.
.SS Connections
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-backend=<HOST>,<PORT>[;<PATTERN>[:...]]
Set  backend  host  and   port.   The  multiple  backend
addresses are  accepted by repeating this  option.  UNIX
domain socket  can be  specified by prefixing  path name
with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/backend.sock).
.sp
Optionally, if <PATTERN>s are given, the backend address
is only used  if request matches the pattern.   If \fI\%\-s\fP or
\fI\%\-p\fP  is  used,  <PATTERN>s   are  ignored.   The  pattern
matching  is closely  designed to  ServeMux in  net/http
package of Go  programming language.  <PATTERN> consists
of path, host + path or just host.  The path must starts
with  "\fI/\fP".  If  it  ends  with "\fI/\fP",  it  matches to  the
request path whose prefix is the path.  To deal with the
request to the directory without trailing slash, pattern
which ends with "\fI/\fP" also  matches the path if pattern ==
path + "\fI/\fP" (e.g.,  pattern "\fI/foo/\fP" matches path "\fI/foo\fP").
If it  does not  end with "\fI/\fP",  it performs  exact match
against the request path.  If host is given, it performs
exact match against the request  host.  If host alone is
given, "\fI/\fP"  is appended  to it, so  that it  matches all
paths  under the  host  (e.g., specifying  "nghttp2.org"
equals to "nghttp2.org/").
.sp
Patterns  with  host  take  precedence  over  path  only
patterns.   Then, longer  patterns take  precedence over
shorter  ones,  breaking  a  tie by  the  order  of  the
appearance in the configuration.
.sp
If <PATTERN> is  omitted, "\fI/\fP" is used  as pattern, which
matches  all paths  (catch\-all pattern).   The catch\-all
backend must be given.
.sp
When doing  a match, nghttpx made  some normalization to
pattern, request host and path.  For host part, they are
converted to lower case.  For path part, percent\-encoded
unreserved characters  defined in RFC 3986  are decoded,
and any  dot\-segments (".."  and ".")   are resolved and
removed.
.sp
For   example,   \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org/httpbin/\(aq
matches the  request host "nghttp2.org" and  the request
path "\fI/httpbin/get\fP", but does not match the request host
"nghttp2.org" and the request path "\fI/index.html\fP".
.sp
The  multiple <PATTERN>s  can  be specified,  delimiting
them            by           ":".             Specifying
\fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org:www.nghttp2.org\(aq  has  the
same  effect  to specify  \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org\(aq
and \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080:www.nghttp2.org\(aq.
.sp
The backend addresses sharing same <PATTERN> are grouped
together forming  load balancing  group.  Since  ";" and
":" are  used as  delimiter, <PATTERN> must  not contain
these characters.
.sp
Default: \fB127.0.0.1,80\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-frontend=<HOST>,<PORT>
Set  frontend  host and  port.   If  <HOST> is  \(aq*\(aq,  it
assumes  all addresses  including  both  IPv4 and  IPv6.
UNIX domain  socket can  be specified by  prefixing path
name with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/nghttpx.sock)

.TP
.B \-\-backend\-http\-proxy\-uri=<URI>
Specify      proxy       URI      in       the      form
\fI\%http:/\fP/[<USER>:<PASS>@]<PROXY>:<PORT>.    If   a   proxy
requires  authentication,  specify  <USER>  and  <PASS>.
Note that  they must be properly  percent\-encoded.  This
proxy  is used  when the  backend connection  is HTTP/2.
First,  make  a CONNECT  request  to  the proxy  and  it
connects  to the  backend  on behalf  of nghttpx.   This
forms  tunnel.   After  that, nghttpx  performs  SSL/TLS
handshake with  the downstream through the  tunnel.  The
timeouts when connecting and  making CONNECT request can
be     specified    by     \fI\%\-\-backend\-read\-timeout\fP    and
\fI\%\-\-backend\-write\-timeout\fP options.

Path  to file  that  contains 48  bytes  random data  to
construct TLS  session ticket parameters.   This options
can  be  used  repeatedly  to  specify  multiple  ticket
parameters.  If several files  are given, only the first
key is used to encrypt  TLS session tickets.  Other keys
are accepted  but server  will issue new  session ticket
with  first  key.   This allows  session  key  rotation.
Please   note  that   key   rotation   does  not   occur
automatically.   User should  rearrange files  or change
options  values  and  restart  nghttpx  gracefully.   If
opening or reading given file fails, all loaded keys are
discarded and it is treated as if none of this option is
given.  If this option is not given or an error occurred
while  opening  or  reading  a file,  key  is  generated

The <DURATION> argument is an integer and an optional unit (e.g., 1s

is omitted, a second is used as unit.

Those lines which are staring \fB#\fP are treated as comment.
.sp
The option name in the configuration file is the long command\-line

\fB=\fP between option name and value.  Don\(aqt put extra leading or
trailing spaces.

To specify private key and certificate file which are given as

.B SIGQUIT
Shutdown gracefully.  First accept pending connections and stop

exits.

.B SIGUSR1
Reopen log files.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Fork and execute nghttpx.  It will execute the binary in the same
path with same command\-line arguments and environment variables.
After new process comes up, sending SIGQUIT to the original process
to perform hot swapping.
.UNINDENT
.SH SERVER PUSH
.sp
nghttpx supports HTTP/2 server push in default mode.  nghttpx looks
for Link header field (\fI\%RFC 5988\fP) in response headers from
backend server and extracts URI\-reference with parameter
\fBrel=preload\fP (see \fI\%preload\fP)
and pushes those URIs to the frontend client. Here is a sample Link
header field to initiate server push:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Link: </fonts/font.woff>; rel=preload
Link: </css/theme.css>; rel=preload
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Currently, the following restrictions are applied for server push:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
URI\-reference must not contain authority.  If it exists, it is not
pushed.  \fB/fonts/font.woff\fP and \fBcss/theme.css\fP are eligible to
be pushed.  \fBhttps://example.org/fonts/font.woff\fP and
\fB//example.org/css/theme.css\fP are not.
.IP 2. 3
The associated stream must have method "GET" or "POST".  The
associated stream\(aqs status code must be 200.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These limitations may be loosened in the future release.
.SH UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET
.sp
nghttpx supports UNIX domain socket with a filename for both frontend
and backend connections.
.sp
Please note that current nghttpx implementation does not delete a
socket with a filename.  And on start up, if nghttpx detects that the
specified socket already exists in the file system, nghttpx first
deletes it.  However, if SIGUSR2 is used to execute new binary and
both old and new configurations use same filename, new binary does not
delete the socket and continues to use it.
.SH OCSP STAPLING
.sp
OCSP query is done using external Python script
\fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP, which has been originally developed in Perl
as part of h2o project (\fI\%https://github.com/h2o/h2o\fP), and was
translated into Python.
.sp
The script file is usually installed under
\fB$(prefix)/share/nghttp2/\fP directory.  The actual path to script can
be customized using \fI\%\-\-fetch\-ocsp\-response\-file\fP option.

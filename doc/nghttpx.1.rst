==========

SYNOPSIS
--------

**nghttpx** [OPTIONS]... [<PRIVATE_KEY> <CERT>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A reverse proxy for HTTP/2, HTTP/1 and SPDY.

.. describe:: <PRIVATE_KEY>

    
    Set path  to server's private key.   Required unless :option:`-p`\,
    :option:`--client` or :option:`\--frontend-no-tls` are given.

.. describe:: <CERT>

    Set path  to server's certificate.  Required  unless :option:`-p`\,
    :option:`--client` or  :option:`\--frontend-no-tls` are given.  To  make OCSP
    stapling work, this must be absolute path.


OPTIONS
-------

The options are categorized into several groups.

Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: -b, --backend=<HOST>,<PORT>[;<PATTERN>[:...]]

    Set  backend  host  and   port.   The  multiple  backend
    addresses are  accepted by repeating this  option.  UNIX
    domain socket  can be  specified by prefixing  path name
    with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/backend.sock).

    Optionally, if <PATTERN>s are given, the backend address
    is only used  if request matches the pattern.   If :option:`-s` or
    :option:`-p`  is  used,  <PATTERN>s   are  ignored.   The  pattern
    matching  is closely  designed to  ServeMux in  net/http
    package of Go  programming language.  <PATTERN> consists
    of path, host + path or just host.  The path must starts
    with  "*/*".  If  it  ends  with "*/*",  it  matches to  the
    request path whose prefix is the path.  To deal with the
    request to the directory without trailing slash, pattern
    which ends with "*/*" also  matches the path if pattern ==
    path + "*/*" (e.g.,  pattern "*/foo/*" matches path "*/foo*").
    If it  does not  end with "*/*",  it performs  exact match
    against the request path.  If host is given, it performs
    exact match against the request  host.  If host alone is
    given, "*/*"  is appended  to it, so  that it  matches all
    paths  under the  host  (e.g., specifying  "nghttp2.org"
    equals to "nghttp2.org/").

    Patterns  with  host  take  precedence  over  path  only
    patterns.   Then, longer  patterns take  precedence over
    shorter  ones,  breaking  a  tie by  the  order  of  the
    appearance in the configuration.

    If <PATTERN> is  omitted, "*/*" is used  as pattern, which
    matches  all paths  (catch-all pattern).   The catch-all
    backend must be given.

    When doing  a match, nghttpx made  some normalization to
    pattern, request host and path.  For host part, they are
    converted to lower case.  For path part, percent-encoded
    unreserved characters  defined in RFC 3986  are decoded,
    and any  dot-segments (".."  and ".")   are resolved and
    removed.

    For   example,   :option:`-b`\'127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org/httpbin/'
    matches the  request host "nghttp2.org" and  the request
    path "*/httpbin/get*", but does not match the request host
    "nghttp2.org" and the request path "*/index.html*".

    The  multiple <PATTERN>s  can  be specified,  delimiting
    them            by           ":".             Specifying
    :option:`-b`\'127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org:www.nghttp2.org'  has  the
    same  effect  to specify  :option:`-b`\'127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org'
    and :option:`-b`\'127.0.0.1,8080:www.nghttp2.org'.

    The backend addresses sharing same <PATTERN> are grouped
    together forming  load balancing  group.  Since  ";" and
    ":" are  used as  delimiter, <PATTERN> must  not contain
    these characters.

    Default: ``127.0.0.1,80``

.. option:: -f, --frontend=<HOST>,<PORT>

    Set  frontend  host and  port.   If  <HOST> is  '\*',  it
    assumes  all addresses  including  both  IPv4 and  IPv6.
    UNIX domain  socket can  be specified by  prefixing path
    name with "unix:" (e.g., unix:/var/run/nghttpx.sock)

    Default: ``*,3000``

.. option:: --backlog=<N>

    Set listen backlog size.

    Default: ``512``

.. option:: --backend-ipv4

    Resolve backend hostname to IPv4 address only.

.. option:: --backend-ipv6

    Resolve backend hostname to IPv6 address only.

.. option:: --backend-http-proxy-uri=<URI>

    Specify      proxy       URI      in       the      form
    http://[<USER>:<PASS>@]<PROXY>:<PORT>.    If   a   proxy
    requires  authentication,  specify  <USER>  and  <PASS>.
    Note that  they must be properly  percent-encoded.  This
    proxy  is used  when the  backend connection  is HTTP/2.
    First,  make  a CONNECT  request  to  the proxy  and  it
    connects  to the  backend  on behalf  of nghttpx.   This
    forms  tunnel.   After  that, nghttpx  performs  SSL/TLS
    handshake with  the downstream through the  tunnel.  The
    timeouts when connecting and  making CONNECT request can
    be     specified    by     :option:`--backend-read-timeout`    and
    :option:`--backend-write-timeout` options.

    option, this limit is applied  to each pattern group (in
    other  words, each  pattern group  can have  maximum <N>
    HTTP/2  connections).  The  default  value  is 0,  which
    means  that  the value  is  adjusted  to the  number  of
    backend addresses.  If pattern  is used, this adjustment
    is done for each pattern group.

.. option:: --backend-http1-connections-per-host=<N>

    Set   maximum  number   of  backend   concurrent  HTTP/1
    connections per origin host.   This option is meaningful
    when :option:`-s` option  is used.  The origin  host is determined
    by  authority  portion  of requset  URI  (or  :authority
    header  field  for  HTTP/2).   To limit  the  number  of
    connections   per  frontend   for   default  mode,   use

    or :option:`--http2-bridge` are given  and :option:`\--backend-no-tls` is not
    given.  The file must be  in PEM format.  It can contain
    multiple  certificates.    If  the  linked   OpenSSL  is
    configured to  load system  wide certificates,  they are
    loaded at startup regardless of this option.

.. option:: --private-key-passwd-file=<PATH>

    Path  to file  that contains  password for  the server's
    private key.   If none is  given and the private  key is
    password protected it'll be requested interactively.

.. option:: --subcert=<KEYPATH>:<CERTPATH>

    Specify  additional certificate  and  private key  file.
    nghttpx will  choose certificates based on  the hostname
    indicated  by  client  using TLS  SNI  extension.   This
    option  can  be  used  multiple  times.   To  make  OCSP
    stapling work, <CERTPATH> must be absolute path.

.. option:: --backend-tls-sni-field=<HOST>

    Explicitly  set the  content of  the TLS  SNI extension.
    This will default to the backend HOST name.

.. option:: --dh-param-file=<PATH>

    Without  this   option,  DHE   cipher  suites   are  not
    available.

.. option:: --npn-list=<LIST>

    Comma delimited list of  ALPN protocol identifier sorted
    in the  order of preference.  That  means most desirable
    protocol comes  first.  This  is used  in both  ALPN and
    NPN.  The parameter must be  delimited by a single comma
    only  and any  white spaces  are  treated as  a part  of
    protocol string.

    Default: ``h2,h2-16,h2-14,spdy/3.1,http/1.1``

.. option:: --verify-client

    Require and verify client certificate.

.. option:: --verify-client-cacert=<PATH>

    Path  to file  that contains  CA certificates  to verify
    client certificate.  The file must be in PEM format.  It
    can contain multiple certificates.

    Comma delimited list of  SSL/TLS protocol to be enabled.
    The following protocols  are available: TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1
    and   TLSv1.0.    The   name   matching   is   done   in
    case-insensitive   manner.    The  parameter   must   be
    delimited by  a single comma  only and any  white spaces
    are treated as a part of protocol string.

    Default: ``TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1``

.. option:: --tls-ticket-key-file=<PATH>

    Path  to file  that  contains 48  bytes  random data  to
    construct TLS  session ticket parameters.   This options
    can  be  used  repeatedly  to  specify  multiple  ticket
    parameters.  If several files  are given, only the first
    key is used to encrypt  TLS session tickets.  Other keys
    are accepted  but server  will issue new  session ticket
    with  first  key.   This allows  session  key  rotation.
    Please   note  that   key   rotation   does  not   occur
    automatically.   User should  rearrange files  or change
    options  values  and  restart  nghttpx  gracefully.   If
    opening or reading given file fails, all loaded keys are
    discarded and it is treated as if none of this option is
    given.  If this option is not given or an error occurred
    while  opening  or  reading  a file,  key  is  generated
    automatically and  renewed every 12hrs.  At  most 2 keys
    are stored in memory.

.. option:: --fetch-ocsp-response-file=<PATH>

    Path to  fetch-ocsp-response script file.  It  should be
    absolute path.

    Set the maximum number of  the concurrent streams in one
    HTTP/2 and SPDY session.

    Default: ``100``

.. option:: --frontend-http2-window-bits=<N>

    Sets the  per-stream initial window size  of HTTP/2 SPDY
    frontend connection.  For HTTP/2,  the size is 2\*\*<N>-1.
    For SPDY, the size is 2\*\*<N>.

    Default: ``16``

.. option:: --frontend-http2-connection-window-bits=<N>

    Sets the  per-connection window size of  HTTP/2 and SPDY
    frontend   connection.    For   HTTP/2,  the   size   is
    2**<N>-1. For SPDY, the size is 2\*\*<N>.

    Default: ``16``

.. option:: --frontend-no-tls

    meant for debugging purpose  and not intended to enhance
    protocol security.

.. option:: --no-server-push

    Disable  HTTP/2  server  push.    Server  push  is  only
    supported  by default  mode and  HTTP/2 frontend.   SPDY
    frontend does not support server push.


Mode
~~~~

.. describe:: (default mode)

    
    Accept  HTTP/2,  SPDY  and HTTP/1.1  over  SSL/TLS.   If
    :option:`--frontend-no-tls` is  used, accept HTTP/2  and HTTP/1.1.
    The  incoming HTTP/1.1  connection  can  be upgraded  to
    HTTP/2  through  HTTP  Upgrade.   The  protocol  to  the
    backend is HTTP/1.1.

.. option:: -s, --http2-proxy

    Like default mode, but enable secure proxy mode.

.. option:: --http2-bridge

    Like default  mode, but communicate with  the backend in
    HTTP/2 over SSL/TLS.  Thus  the incoming all connections
    are converted  to HTTP/2  connection and relayed  to the
    backend.  See :option:`--backend-http-proxy-uri` option if you are
    behind  the proxy  and want  to connect  to the  outside
    HTTP/2 proxy.

.. option:: --client

    Accept  HTTP/2   and  HTTP/1.1  without   SSL/TLS.   The
    incoming HTTP/1.1  connection can be upgraded  to HTTP/2
    connection through  HTTP Upgrade.   The protocol  to the
    backend is HTTP/2.   To use nghttpx as  a forward proxy,
    use :option:`-p` option instead.

.. option:: -p, --client-proxy

    Like :option:`--client`  option, but it also  requires the request
    path from frontend must be an absolute URI, suitable for
    use as a forward proxy.


Logging
~~~~~~~

.. option:: -L, --log-level=<LEVEL>

    Set the severity  level of log output.   <LEVEL> must be
    one of INFO, NOTICE, WARN, ERROR and FATAL.

    Default: ``NOTICE``

.. option:: --accesslog-file=<PATH>

    Set path to write access log.  To reopen file, send USR1
    signal to nghttpx.

.. option:: --accesslog-syslog

    Send  access log  to syslog.   If this  option is  used,
    :option:`--accesslog-file` option is ignored.

.. option:: --accesslog-format=<FORMAT>

      '_' in <VAR> is replaced with '-'.
    * $remote_port: client  port.
    * $server_port: server port.
    * $request_time: request processing time in seconds with
      milliseconds resolution.
    * $pid: PID of the running process.
    * $alpn: ALPN identifier of the protocol which generates
      the response.   For HTTP/1,  ALPN is  always http/1.1,
      regardless of minor version.
    * $ssl_cipher: cipher used for SSL/TLS connection.
    * $ssl_protocol: protocol for SSL/TLS connection.
    * $ssl_session_id: session ID for SSL/TLS connection.
    * $ssl_session_reused:  "r"   if  SSL/TLS   session  was
      reused.  Otherwise, "."


    Default: ``$remote_addr - - [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"``

.. option:: --errorlog-file=<PATH>

    Set path to write error  log.  To reopen file, send USR1
    signal  to nghttpx.   stderr will  be redirected  to the
    error log file unless :option:`--errorlog-syslog` is used.

    Default: ``/dev/stderr``

.. option:: --errorlog-syslog

    Send  error log  to  syslog.  If  this  option is  used,
    :option:`--errorlog-file` option is ignored.

.. option:: --frontend-http2-dump-response-header=<PATH>

    Dumps response headers sent  from HTTP/2 frontend to the
    file denoted  in <PATH>.  The  output is done  in HTTP/1
    header field format and each header block is followed by
    an empty line.  This option  is not thread safe and MUST
    NOT be used with option :option:`-n`\<N>, where <N> >= 2.

.. option:: -o, --frontend-frame-debug

    Print HTTP/2 frames in  frontend to stderr.  This option
    is  not thread  safe and  MUST NOT  be used  with option
    :option:`-n`\=N, where N >= 2.


Process
~~~~~~~

.. option:: -D, --daemon

    Run in a background.  If :option:`-D` is used, the current working
    directory is changed to '*/*'.

.. option:: --pid-file=<PATH>

    Set path to save PID of this program.

.. option:: --user=<USER>

    Run this program as <USER>.   This option is intended to
    be used to drop root privileges.


Misc
~~~~

.. option:: --conf=<PATH>

    Load configuration from <PATH>.

    Default: ``/etc/nghttpx/nghttpx.conf``

.. option:: --include=<PATH>

    Load additional configurations from <PATH>.  File <PATH>
    is  read  when  configuration  parser  encountered  this
    option.  This option can be used multiple times, or even
    recursively.

.. option:: -v, --version

    Print version and exit.

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print this help and exit.



The <SIZE> argument is an integer and an optional unit (e.g., 10K is
10 * 1024).  Units are K, M and G (powers of 1024).

The <DURATION> argument is an integer and an optional unit (e.g., 1s
is 1 second and 500ms is 500 milliseconds).  Units are h, m, s or ms
(hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, respectively).  If a unit
is omitted, a second is used as unit.

FILES
-----

*/etc/nghttpx/nghttpx.conf*
  The default configuration file path nghttpx searches at startup.
  The configuration file path can be changed using :option:`--conf`
  option.

  Those lines which are staring ``#`` are treated as comment.

  The option name in the configuration file is the long command-line
  option name with leading ``--`` stripped (e.g., ``frontend``).  Put
  ``=`` between option name and value.  Don't put extra leading or
  trailing spaces.

  The options which do not take argument in the command-line *take*
  argument in the configuration file.  Specify ``yes`` as an argument
  (e.g., ``http2-proxy=yes``).  If other string is given, it is
  ignored.

  To specify private key and certificate file which are given as
  positional arguments in command-line, use ``private-key-file`` and
  ``certificate-file``.

  :option:`--conf` option cannot be used in the configuration file and
  will be ignored if specified.

SIGNALS
-------

SIGQUIT
  Shutdown gracefully.  First accept pending connections and stop
  accepting connection.  After all connections are handled, nghttpx
  exits.

SIGUSR1
  Reopen log files.

SIGUSR2
  Fork and execute nghttpx.  It will execute the binary in the same
  path with same command-line arguments and environment variables.
  After new process comes up, sending SIGQUIT to the original process
  to perform hot swapping.

SERVER PUSH
-----------

nghttpx supports HTTP/2 server push in default mode.  nghttpx looks
for Link header field (`RFC 5988
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`_) in response headers from
backend server and extracts URI-reference with parameter
``rel=preload`` (see `preload
<http://w3c.github.io/preload/#interoperability-with-http-link-header>`_)
and pushes those URIs to the frontend client. Here is a sample Link
header field to initiate server push:

.. code-block:: http

  Link: </fonts/font.woff>; rel=preload
  Link: </css/theme.css>; rel=preload

Currently, the following restrictions are applied for server push:

1. URI-reference must not contain authority.  If it exists, it is not
   pushed.  ``/fonts/font.woff`` and ``css/theme.css`` are eligible to
   be pushed.  ``https://example.org/fonts/font.woff`` and
   ``//example.org/css/theme.css`` are not.

2. The associated stream must have method "GET" or "POST".  The
   associated stream's status code must be 200.

These limitations may be loosened in the future release.

UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET
------------------

nghttpx supports UNIX domain socket with a filename for both frontend
and backend connections.

Please note that current nghttpx implementation does not delete a
socket with a filename.  And on start up, if nghttpx detects that the
specified socket already exists in the file system, nghttpx first
deletes it.  However, if SIGUSR2 is used to execute new binary and
both old and new configurations use same filename, new binary does not
delete the socket and continues to use it.

OCSP STAPLING
-------------

OCSP query is done using external Python script
``fetch-ocsp-response``, which has been originally developed in Perl
as part of h2o project (https://github.com/h2o/h2o), and was
translated into Python.

The script file is usually installed under
``$(prefix)/share/nghttp2/`` directory.  The actual path to script can
be customized using :option:`--fetch-ocsp-response-file` option.

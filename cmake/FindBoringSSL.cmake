# - Try to find BoringSSL include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(BoringSSL)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  BORINGSSL_ROOT_DIR          Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            boringssl if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  BORINGSSL_FOUND             System has boringssl, include and library dirs found
#  BORINGSSL_INCLUDE_DIR       The boringssl include directories.
#  BORINGSSL_LIBRARIES         The boringssl libraries.
#  BORINGSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY    The boringssl crypto library.
#  BORINGSSL_SSL_LIBRARY       The boringssl ssl library.
